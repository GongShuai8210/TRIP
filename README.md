# Parameter-Free Token-Level Prompt Mixture for Federated Domain Generalization

This project implements our paper.

**Abstract:** Federated domain generalization (FedDG) aims to learn a globally generalizable model from decentralized clients with heterogeneous data while preserving privacy. Recent studies have introduced prompt learning to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) in FedDG by learning a single global prompt. However,
such a one-prompt-fits-all learning paradigm typically leads to performance degradation on personalized samples. Although the mixture of experts (MoE) offers a promising solution for specialization, existing MoE-based methods suffer from coarse image-level expert assignment and high communication costs from parameterized routers. To address these limitations, we propose TRIP, a Token-level pRompt mIxture with Parameter-free routing framework for FedDG, which treats multiple prompts as distinct experts. Unlike existing image-level routing designs, TRIP assigns different tokens within an image to specific experts. To ensure communication efficiency, TRIP incorporates a parameter-free routing mechanism based on token clustering and optimal transport. The instance-specific prompt is then synthesized by aggregating experts, weighted by the number of tokens assigned to each. Additionally, TRIP develops an unbiased
learning strategy for prompt experts, leveraging the VLMâ€™s zeroshot generalization capability. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that TRIP achieves optimal generalization results, with communicating only 1K parameters per round.

## How to run

Before running the training script, you should generate the  weights for prompt  experts  using the code in /utils/generate_weights_multi.py.

We also provided the weights in  weight_dir.

We provide the commands  in Office-Home to reproduce the results.

```shell
bash tarin.sh
```
